# Getting Started with Ricky & Morty App
**Introduction**
In this project, I utilized React.js to interact with the Rick and Morty API, which provides access to information about the characters, episodes, and locations from the popular animated TV series "Rick and Morty". The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore the data provided by the API.

**Choice of REST Endpoint**
For this project, I chose to work with the REST endpoints provided by the Rick and Morty API. The RESTful architecture aligns well with the principles of React.js, making it easier to fetch and manipulate data within the application. React's built-in features and libraries such as fetch or axios enable seamless integration with REST endpoints, allowing for efficient data retrieval and rendering.

**Technology Stack**
Frontend: React.js
Styling: Sass,Bootstrap,css
Type Checking: TypeScript
**Design and Implementation Decisions**
**Frontend Framework Selection**
Given the preference for React TypeScript and Next.js in our full-stack projects, I opted to leverage React.js for the frontend development. React's component-based architecture facilitates modular development, enabling better organization and reusability of code components.

**Styling with Sass**
Sass was chosen for styling purposes due to its enhanced features such as variables, nesting, and mixins, which streamline the styling process and improve code maintainability. Sass enables the creation of scalable and maintainable stylesheets, enhancing the overall development experience.
